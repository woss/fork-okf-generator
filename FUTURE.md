# Future Plans

Ordered by development effort (easiest first).

---

## ~~1. CI/CD Realworld Bundle Auto-Publish~~ ✅ Done (v0.1.44)

**What was done:** Extended `.github/workflows/demo-viz.yml` to generate `docs/okf_bundle/` from `tests/fixtures/realworld/` on every push to `main`. Added bundle verification (≥10 concept files). Landing page "Try it live" section now has a "Live Bundle" link. Updated `.gitignore` to un-ignore `docs/okf_bundle/`.

---

## ~~2. User-Facing Auto-Bundle Template~~ ✅ Done (v0.1.44)

**What was done:** Created `docs/examples/okf-auto-bundle.yml` — a ready-to-copy workflow. Updated `docs/user-guide/ci-cd.md` with the full template and explanation. Updated README link to point to new CI/CD doc.

---

## ~~3. v0.2 Schema Bump~~ ✅ Done (v0.1.44)

**What was done:**
- Bumped `"0.1"` → `"0.2"` in all generator emission points (4 locations)
- Added `okf_version`, `concept_id`, `language`, `status` to every concept frontmatter
- Added `status` field to `Concept` dataclass
- Merged `## Related`, `## Calls`, `## Called By` sections into a single `## Relationships` table with typed edges (related, calls, called_by, related (AI))
- Updated `lookup.py` and `pairs.py` to read `relationships` section (with v0.1 fallback)
- Created `okf migrate v0.1-to-v0.2` command with `--dry-run` support
- Updated `bundle-format.md` doc with v0.2 schema

---

## ~~4. `okf agent` REPL~~ ✅ Done (v0.1.44)

**What was done:**
- Created `okf/agent.py` — interactive REPL with rich card output, slash commands (`/lookup`, `/source`, `/calls`, `/called-by`, `/related`, `/save`, `/export`, `/history`, `/clear`, `/resume`, `/sessions`)
- Persistent sessions saved to `~/.okf/sessions/ses_*.json`
- LLM-powered Q&A with context-aware follow-ups (reuses `_search_context` + `_ask_llm` from `okf/ask.py`)
- Session export to JSON or Markdown
- Auto-save every 4 exchanges
- Wired into CLI as `okf agent`

**What it unlocks:** Replaces the "grep files → read sources" loop entirely. Agent (human or AI) stays inside `okf` for the whole exploration flow.

---

## ~~4. Tree-sitter WASM in Viz~~ ✅ Done (v0.1.44)

**What was done:**
- Added `web-tree-sitter` + per-language WASM parsers loaded from jsDelivr CDN (17 languages)
- Code panel now has a "Source" / "Parse Tree" tab switcher
- Parse Tree renders a collapsible named AST tree with syntax-colored tokens
- Deeply nested nodes auto-collapse for readability
- Falls back gracefully if WASM fails to load (network issue, unsupported lang)
- All 242 tests pass

**What it unlocks:** Viz is no longer a static snapshot. It's an interactive AST browser — click any concept, switch to Parse Tree, see the full tree-sitter parse tree with collapsible scopes and syntax highlighting. Works offline after first load (CDN-cached WASM).

---

## 5. IDE Plugins

**Effort:** Very High (2–4 weeks each)

**VS Code extension:** Reads `.okf_bundle/` from workspace root. Shows hover tooltips with docstrings/signatures, call-graph peek, jump-to-def across languages. Uses bundle's cross-reference data (no language server needed).

**JetBrains plugin:** Same concept via IntelliJ plugin SDK.

**What it unlocks:** OKF becomes invisible — developers get codebase-wide context without leaving their editor. Makes the bundle useful for humans, not just AI agents.
